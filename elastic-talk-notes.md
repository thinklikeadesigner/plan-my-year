## Talk Angle

"Don't Reinvent the Wheel" - How I unknowingly rebuilt Elastic features because Relevanssi was too limited.

**Key themes:**
- Offline indexing
- Change detection (content hashing)
- Feature extraction (specialties, team aggregation)
- Custom ranking models (crude weight multipliers vs proper scoring)
- Data ingestion patterns similar to Elastic

**Takeaway:** When to reach for Elastic instead of building it yourself

## Timeline

- **Outline due:** Friday, Feb 20, 2026
- **Talk delivery:** TBD (likely mid-March)

## Contacts

- **Olivia Petrie** - Program Manager, DevRel (olivia@elastic.co)
- **Sophia Solomon** - Developer Advocate, Austin
