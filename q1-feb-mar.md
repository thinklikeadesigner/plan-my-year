# Q1 2026 (February - March) — Phases 1-3

## Phase 1: Finish the Weapon (Feb 8-28)

### DSA — Structy is primary (10-14 hrs/week from Core + Flex)
- [ ] **Finish Structy** (11/114 done, 103 remaining — ~25-30/week across 3 weeks + overflow)
  - HIGH priority: DP (15 left), Graph II (16 left), Exhaustive Recursion (12 left)
  - Then: Stack (7), Array+String (10), Linked List II (5), Binary Tree II (12), Heap (7)
  - Last: Mixed Recall (19) — overflow into Mar 1-7
- [ ] 30-day Instagram challenge continues independently (1 problem/day)
- [ ] NeetCode 150: deferred to after Structy — becomes primary in Phase 2+
- [ ] Explain approach out loud. No IDE autocomplete.
- [ ] Can't solve in time limit → study solution 10 min, re-attempt in 3 days

### DDIA (2 hrs/week)
- [ ] Chapter 5: Replication (Week of Feb 9)
- [ ] Chapter 6: Partitioning (Week of Feb 16)
- [ ] Chapter 7: Transactions (Week of Feb 23)
- [ ] Take notes as if teaching each chapter. 1-paragraph summary after each.

### Networking (2 hrs/week)
- [ ] Follow up with Amazon engineer (coffee or run, late Feb)
- [ ] Attend Founders Run Club at least once before hackathon
- [ ] Attend one ATX Divas Run Club
- [ ] **OpenClaw hackathon Feb 13-14** — networking > winning. Follow up contacts within 48 hrs.
- [ ] **YC founders hackathon Feb 20** (tentative, 5 hrs) — go if strong networking potential
- [ ] **UT AI/Memory hackathon Feb 25** (6-8:30pm) — different crowd, low cost
- [ ] After each hackathon: back to Structy next day. No post-hackathon iteration.

### LinkedIn (1 hr/week)
- [ ] Post AI Refactor carousel (Week 1 of content)
- [ ] Goes up BEFORE any applications

---

## Phase 2: System Design Sprint (Mar 1-21)

### System Design (5 hrs/week)
- [ ] One Educative/Grokking problem per day, 6 days/week = 18 designs
- [ ] Sketch own design in 20 min BEFORE looking at answer
- [ ] Priority order (platform/infra focus):
  1. Rate limiter
  2. Distributed cache
  3. Message queue / pub-sub
  4. Web crawler
  5. **Search indexing system** (home turf — "I actually built one")
  6. Notification service
  7. URL shortener
  8. Key-value store
  9. Distributed file storage
  10. Monitoring/alerting system

**Secret weapon:** Weave in real stories. Indexing pipeline for search design. Workday sync for data pipeline design. Hash-based dedup for image processing design.

### DDIA (2 hrs/week)
- [ ] Chapter 8: The Trouble with Distributed Systems (Week of Mar 2)
- [ ] Chapter 9: Consistency and Consensus (Week of Mar 9)
- [ ] Review + synthesize chapters 5-9 (Week of Mar 16)

### Networking (2 hrs/week)
- [ ] Coffee chat with Amazon engineer (aim for Week of Mar 3 or Mar 10)
- [ ] Follow up with hackathon contacts within 48 hours (LinkedIn + "great building with you")
- [ ] Post IoT Form carousel on LinkedIn (Week of Mar 10)
- [ ] Engage meaningfully on 3-5 posts/week from engineers at target companies

---

## Phase 3 Start: Behavioral + Mocks (Mar 22-31)

### Behavioral Story Bank (Week of Mar 22)
- [ ] Story 1: Indexing Pipeline (STAR format, timed at 2 min)
- [ ] Story 2: Workday Integration
- [ ] Story 3: Image Dedup Pipeline
- [ ] Story 4: IoT Form Redesign
- [ ] Story 5: AI-Assisted MVC Refactor
- [ ] Story 6: The Showing-Up Story

### Mock Interviews (start Week of Mar 29)
- [ ] Schedule 2 coding mocks on Pramp (free)
- [ ] Schedule 2 coding mocks on Interviewing.io (paid)
- [ ] Find system design mock partner (Austin network or Interviewing.io)
- [ ] Find behavioral mock partner

After each mock, debrief: What went well? Where did I freeze? What surprised me? What would I do differently?

### Networking
- [ ] If Amazon coffee chat went well → referral ask: "I'm starting to look at platform/infra roles. If you think it might be a fit, I'd love to learn about the referral process."
- [ ] Post brand statement synthesis on LinkedIn (after both carousels are up)
