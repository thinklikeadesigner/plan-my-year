## Current Status (Feb 8)

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| **DSA** | Structy: 11/114 done, 103 remaining (DP 7/22, Graph II 0/16, ExRec 0/12, Stack 0/7, ArrStr 2/12, LL2 2/7, BT2 0/12, Heap 0/7, Mixed 0/19). Structy is primary until complete, then NeetCode 150. 30-day Instagram challenge (~Day 13-15). Weak: DP (52 min avg), graphs (48 min), backtracking (45 min). Strong: arrays, hashmaps, two pointers, sliding window, trees. |
| **System Design** | Read: Grokking, Alex Xu Vol 1, System Design Primer, Raft paper. DDIA started (10 pages). Educative.io access. No structured practice yet. |
| **Behavioral** | Zero structured prep. Great stories, not in STAR format. |
| **Mock Interviews** | Zero. Single biggest risk factor. |
| **Networking** | Amazon engineer (women's SWE meetup), EPFL engineer (hackathon invite Feb 20), Founders Run Club, ATX Divas Run Club, Meta data scientist (Ryan Will from AI camp). |
| **LinkedIn** | Two carousels planned (AI refactor, IoT form). Brand statement drafted. Not yet posted. |

## Goal 1: Land Big Tech Platform Engineer Role

### Target Companies

| Tier | Companies | Strategy |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Tier 1 — Dream** | Google (Cloud/Infra), Meta (Infrastructure) | Referral only |
| **Tier 2 — Strong** | Amazon (AWS/Platform), Microsoft (Azure/Platform) | Referral or warm recruiter intro |
| **Tier 3 — Strategic** | Snap, TikTok, Cloudflare, Datadog, Figma | Easier interviews, good comp, real logos |
| **Tier 4 — Practice** | LinkedIn, Stripe, Uber, Indeed, Oracle Cloud | Practice reps + backup |

### Compensation Targets

| Company | Base | Stock/yr | Bonus | Total Comp |
|---------|------|----------|-------|------------|
| Google L4 | $140-160K | $100-150K | $15-25K | $255-335K |
| Meta E4 | $145-165K | $80-120K | $15-25K | $240-310K |
| Amazon SDE II | $130-150K | $60-100K | signing | $190-250K |
| Microsoft L62 | $130-155K | $60-100K | $15-20K | $205-275K |

**Comp script:** "I'm targeting market rate for SWE II platform roles in Austin. I'm flexible on the structure — I care about total comp and the opportunity."

### Phase Timeline

| Phase | Dates | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Phase 1: Finish the Weapon** | Feb 8-28 | Finish Structy (103 remaining), DDIA Ch 5-7, 2-3 hackathons, LinkedIn content |
| **Phase 2: System Design Sprint** | Mar 1-21 | 18 system design problems, DDIA Ch 8-9 |
| **Phase 3: Behavioral + Mocks** | Mar 22 - Apr 11 | 6 STAR stories, 8-10 mock interviews |
| **Phase 4: Application Blitz** | Apr 14-18 | All targets simultaneously, referral-attached |
| **Phase 5: Interview Gauntlet** | Apr 21 - May 30 | Tier 4 first (practice), then Tier 3, then Tier 1-2 |
| **Phase 6: Negotiation** | May/June | Competing offers, never give a number first |

### The 5 Blocks to Address

1. **Resume is a black hole for cold apps** → 100% referral-based. Zero portal submissions without warm intro.
2. **Never done a mock interview** → Minimum 8-10 mocks before first real interview.
3. **Behavioral stories unstructured** → 6 STAR stories, rehearsed and timed at 2 min each.
4. **Side quest trap** → "Does this move me closer to a FAANG offer in 90 days?" If no, write it in Post-FAANG Ideas doc.
5. **Undersold on compensation** → Never anchor to current salary. Target market rate total comp.

### Resume Bullets (Platform Engineering Frame)

- Designed incremental indexing pipeline reducing reindex time from 20 min → 1 sec
- Built API integration layer consuming REST APIs, synchronizing 700+ employee records
- Engineered image sync pipeline: 750+ records/run, 92% cache hit via hash-based dedup, zero errors
- Implemented cache invalidation and purging strategies across multi-tenant production
- Designed constraint-based form system modeling field dependencies as DAG, eliminating 100% invalid submissions

## Goal 2: Lose 10 lbs + Build Fitness Habit

**Target:** 156.5 lbs → 146.5 lbs

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Start weight | 156.5 lbs |
| Target weight | 146.5 lbs |
| Rate | 0.7 lbs/week |
| ETA | Mid-May (~14 weeks) |
| Tool | MacroFactor |

**Fitness Schedule:**
- Boulder/Lift: Thu, Sat (gym 35min away)
- Walk/Run: Tue, Wed, Fri (local)
- Rest: Sun

## Goal 3: Network as Application Pipeline

Networking is not a separate goal — it IS the job search. Every event, coffee chat, and run club is a job application in disguise.

**Active Contacts:**

| Contact | Source | Status | Next Step |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Amazon engineer | Women's SWE meetup | Warm (gave value: run club invite) | Coffee/run late Feb. Referral ask Week 8-9. |
| EPFL engineer (Armel) | Hackathon invite | Feb 20 hackathon | Show up, build well, 30 min genuine conversation. |
| Sophie (recruiter) | Previous contact | Ghosted after resume | One polite follow-up. If no response, move on. |
| Daniel | Founders Run Club | Met Feb 7 | Stay visible at run club. |
| Ryan Will | AI camp meetup | Met Feb 4, Meta data scientist | LinkedIn connection, stay in touch. |

**Weekly non-negotiables:**
- 1 networking touchpoint (message, coffee, event)
- 1 LinkedIn post or engagement session

---

## Constraints

- Employed 9-5
- Tue/Wed: In-office (2hr commute via 2-house system)
- Mon/Thu/Fri: WFH

## Behavioral Story Bank

| # | Story | Maps To |
|---|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Indexing Pipeline** — Full reindex 20 min → 1 sec via incremental indexing | Technical challenge, Deliver results, Dive deep |
| 2 | **Workday Integration** — API-driven sync of 700+ records across systems | Simplify, Invent and simplify, Bias for action |
| 3 | **Image Dedup Pipeline** — Hash-based dedup, 750+ records, 92% skip rate, zero errors | Optimize, Insist on highest standards |
| 4 | **IoT Form Redesign** — DAG-modeled field dependencies, zero invalid submissions | Customer obsession, Think big |
| 5 | **AI-Assisted MVC Refactor** — 15 templates → single MVC under 3-week deadline | Bias for action, Learn and be curious |
| 6 | **The Showing-Up Story** — Breakup text → showed up → met Amazon engineer | Earn trust, Have backbone, resilience |

## Backup Scenarios

**If FAANG doesn't work by June:**
- **Option A:** Tier 3 companies as primary (Cloudflare, Datadog, Figma, Stripe, Uber)
- **Option B:** Austin startup play (Series B+, $140-170K+, 10x ownership)
- **Option C:** Re-prep Q3/Q4 with real interview experience

**If offer is lukewarm:** Take it if comp is right. Leave in 18-24 months. Logo and salary are the point.

**If entrepreneurship pull gets strong:** Deal with yourself — build after 18 months at big tech. Salary funds runway, logo gives credibility, network gives co-founders.

---

## Guardrails

1. **1 true rest day/week** — no study, no guilt (Sunday evening)
2. **Weekly review (15 min)** — Sunday, check progress and adjust
3. **Core vs Flex distinction** — Core hours are non-negotiable, Flex is bonus
4. **Permission to flex** — if interviews heat up, skip a meetup; if energy tanks, eat at maintenance
5. **Side quest filter** — "Does this move me closer to a FAANG offer in 90 days?"
6. **Post-FAANG Ideas doc** — capture every side quest idea, revisit after offer secured
