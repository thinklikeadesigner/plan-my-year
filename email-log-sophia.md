Hey Sophia!

I had such a good time on our call Wednesday! Honestly, meeting another STEM to tech person felt like finding a unicorn haha.

I've been thinking about the talk. I want to share the ETL pipeline I built for our staff search system with things like incremental indexing, change detection, cross-document aggregation, maybe even the CLI commands I cooked up for emergencies. I built it as a solo engineer figuring things out as I went, so it's a pretty practical, hands-on story.

I'll get you a detailed outline by Friday the 20th!

Rebecca
