# Quick Start — New Commands

## Test the New Features

### 1. Test Story Rehearsal
```bash
cd /Users/R-Burch/Desktop/agent-workflows/plan-my-year
claude
```

Then in Claude:
```
> story indexing
```

This will display the full Indexing Pipeline story in STAR format and prompt you to rehearse it.

### 2. Test Network Commands

**Add the contacts you've already met:**
```
> network add "Ryan Will" "Meta" "AI camp meetup Feb 4"
> network add "Daniel" "Unknown" "Founders Run Club Feb 7, AI/ML engineer"
> network add "Armel Talla" "EPFL" "OpenClaw hackathon invite Feb 13-14"
```

**See who needs follow-up:**
```
> network next
```

**Find contacts at a specific company:**
```
> network search meta
```

---

### 3. Test Pipeline Command

```
> pipeline
```

This will show you're in Phase 1 (no applications yet) and remind you to focus on DSA prep.

1. ✅ **Add your existing contacts** to contacts.md using `network add`
2. ✅ Test `network next` to see the follow-up list
3. ⏭️ Get back to Structy (Week 2 target: 25 problems)

### Phase 1 Focus:

## The Rule

Every time you feel the pull to build something new, ask:

**"Does this move me closer to a FAANG offer in the next 90 days?"**

If the answer is no, write it in a "Post-FAANG Ideas" doc and move on.

The tools are done. Execute the plan.

## Current Priorities

1. **Structy:** 103 problems remaining (11/114 done)
2. **Week 2 target:** 25 problems (DP finish, Stack finish, Graph II start)
3. **OpenClaw hackathon:** Fri-Sat (Feb 13-14) — relationships > winning
4. **Follow-ups:** 48 hours after hackathon (by Mon Feb 16)

The weapon comes first. Everything else is a distraction.
