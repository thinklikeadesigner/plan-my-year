## Notes

- Hackathon shifted to 5pm Friday. PTO day = bonus study block. 21 hrs study instead of original 15.
- DP is the hardest section. If you're stuck on a problem for >25 min: study the solution for 10 min, move on, re-attempt in 3 days.
- Explain your approach out loud on every problem. Interview practice starts now.
