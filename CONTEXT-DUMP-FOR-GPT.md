## MISSION STATEMENT

Land a platform engineering role at a top-tier tech company by June 2026. 100% referral-based applications. Network IS the application pipeline.

**Current role:** Employed 9-5 at Texas A&M Transportation Institute (research + platform engineering)
**Background:** Career changer (B.S. Biomedical Science, Texas A&M, 2017, GPA 3.2) → self-taught software engineer
**Constraints:** Tue/Wed office (2hr commute via 2-house system), Mon/Thu/Fri WFH
**Study budget:** 10-15 hrs/week core, up to 23 hrs with flex

---

## THE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

This is a **cascading time-horizon planning system** that breaks down yearly goals into actionable daily tasks through 6 levels:

1. **Year** → Define success criteria
2. **Quarterly** → Major milestones
3. **Monthly** → Concrete targets
4. **Weekly** → Task breakdown
5. **Daily** → Schedule integration
6. **Hourly** → Time-blocked templates

**Key principle:** Human-in-the-loop checkpoints. Agent must STOP after each level for user approval before continuing deeper.

## THE 3 GOALS

### Goal 1: Land Big Tech Platform Engineer Role

**Target companies (tiered):**
- **Tier 1 (Dream):** Google Cloud/Infra, Meta Infrastructure
- **Tier 2 (Strong):** Amazon AWS/Platform, Microsoft Azure/Platform
- **Tier 3 (Strategic):** Snap, TikTok, Cloudflare, Datadog, Figma, Elastic
- **Tier 4 (Practice):** LinkedIn, Stripe, Uber, Indeed, Oracle Cloud

**Compensation targets:** $240-335K total comp (Google L4: $255-335K, Meta E4: $240-310K, Amazon SDE II: $190-250K, Microsoft L62: $205-275K)

**The 5 blockers to address:**
1. Resume is a black hole → 100% referral-based applications
2. Never done a mock interview → 8-10 mocks before first real interview
3. Behavioral stories unstructured → 6 STAR stories, rehearsed at 2 min each
4. Side quest trap → "Does this move me closer to a FAANG offer in 90 days?"
5. Undersold on compensation → Never anchor to current salary

**Phase timeline:**
- **Phase 1 (Feb 8-28):** Finish Structy (103 remaining), DDIA Ch 5-7, 2-3 hackathons
- **Phase 2 (Mar 1-21):** 18 system design problems, DDIA Ch 8-9
- **Phase 3 (Mar 22-Apr 11):** 6 STAR stories, 8-10 mock interviews
- **Phase 4 (Apr 14-18):** All targets simultaneously, referral-attached
- **Phase 5 (Apr 21-May 30):** Interview gauntlet (Tier 4 first for practice)
- **Phase 6 (May/June):** Negotiation with competing offers

### Goal 2: Lose 10 lbs + Build Fitness Habit

**Target:** 156.5 → 146.5 lbs (0.7 lbs/week, ETA mid-May)
**Tool:** MacroFactor app

**Fitness schedule:**
- Boulder/Lift: Thu, Sat (gym 35min away)
- Walk/Run: Tue, Wed, Fri (local)
- Rest: Sun

### Goal 3: Network as Application Pipeline

**Active contacts:**
- **Olivia Petrie (Elastic):** Program Manager DevRel, invited to present at Elastic Austin meetup, send talk outline by end of week
- **Sophia Solomon (Elastic):** Developer Advocate, workshop call Feb 12 went great (connected over shared biochem → tech background), send talk outline within 24hrs
- **Holt (Google):** Developer Advocate, bridge node into Google, gave A2A talk at AI meetup, need second interaction by mid-March, potential intro to platform engineer
- **Isha (Amazon):** SWE at Amazon, met at Women's SWE meetup Feb 6, gave value first (run club invite Feb 7), coffee late Feb, referral ask Week 8-9
- **Daniel (EPFL/Mitre):** AI/ML engineer, met at Founders Run Club Feb 7, registered for OpenClaw hackathon together
- **Ryan Will (Meta):** Data scientist (not eng - weak referral), met at AI camp meetup Feb 4
- **Daniel Lam (Microsoft):** TTI student worker, got return offer at Microsoft, LinkedIn connection (congratulated on new position)
- **James Black (TikTok maybe):** Met at Founders Run Club, hung out at Barton Springs Feb 7, owns marketing agency, said he used to work at TikTok

**Weekly non-negotiables:**
- 1 networking touchpoint (message, coffee, event)
- 1 LinkedIn post or engagement session

## BEHAVIORAL STORY BANK (6 STAR Stories)

All stories should be rehearsed out loud and timed at ~2 minutes.

1. **Indexing Pipeline** — 20 min → 1 sec via incremental indexing (Technical challenge, Deliver results)
2. **Workday Integration** — API-driven sync of 700+ records (Simplify, Bias for action)
3. **Image Dedup Pipeline** — Hash-based dedup, 92% skip rate, zero errors (Optimize, Highest standards)
4. **IoT Form Redesign** — DAG-modeled field dependencies, zero invalid submissions (Customer obsession, Think big)
5. **AI-Assisted MVC Refactor** — 15 templates → single MVC under 3-week deadline (Bias for action, Learn and be curious)
6. **The Showing-Up Story** — Breakup text → showed up → met Amazon engineer (Earn trust, Have backbone, Resilience)

**Rehearsal schedule:** Starting Phase 3 (Mar 22+), rehearse 2 stories per week.

---

## SUSTAINABILITY GUARDRAILS

1. **One true rest day per week** — Sunday evening, no study, no guilt
2. **Weekly review ritual** — 15-30 min Sunday evening
3. **Core vs Flex hour distinction** — Core hours non-negotiable, Flex is bonus
4. **Permission to adjust** — If interviews heat up, skip a meetup; if energy tanks, eat at maintenance
5. **Side quest filter** — "Does this move me closer to a FAANG offer in 90 days?" If no, write it in Post-FAANG Ideas doc

---

## NEGOTIATION PRINCIPLES

From `claude.md` — these are non-negotiable:

1. **Never accept on the spot** — ask for time to review
2. **Never give a number first** — ask for their range
3. **Always negotiate** — even if it's good
4. **Use competing offers as leverage**
5. **Your current salary is irrelevant**

**Comp script:** "I'm targeting market rate for SWE II platform roles in Austin. I'm flexible on the structure — I care about total comp and the opportunity."

---

## VERSION CONTROL RULE

After making any changes to project files (goals, plans, tracker, etc.):
1. `git add .`
2. `git commit -m "update"`
3. `git push`

This ensures all progress is backed up and synced.

## HOW TO USE THIS WITH CHATGPT

### As a planning assistant:
"I'm in Phase 1, Week 2 of a 6-month goal to land a Big Tech platform engineer role. Here's my current state: [paste tracker.csv latest row]. Can you help me adjust this week's plan based on the OpenClaw hackathon eating 8 hours of study time?"

### As a progress analyzer:
"Here's my tracker.csv. Am I on track to finish Structy by Feb 28? If not, what adjustments should I make?"

### As a networking coach:
"Here's my contacts.md. Who should I follow up with this week? Draft a message for Isha (Amazon) asking for coffee late Feb."

### As a story coach:
"Here's my Indexing Pipeline story. Time me at 2 minutes and give feedback on clarity, structure, and impact."

### As a job search strategist:
"I'm entering Phase 4 in 63 days. Review my networking contacts and tell me which target companies I still need referrals for, and how to prioritize filling those gaps."

## KEY INSIGHTS FROM CLAUDE.md

This system is designed around **human-in-the-loop checkpoints**. The agent should:
- STOP after each time horizon for approval
- NEVER skip ahead without user confirmation
- Incorporate feedback before moving to next level
- Use Core vs Flex distinction to prevent burnout
- Flag overcommitment during feasibility checks
- Include one true rest day per week

**Checkpoint rule:** After presenting each breakdown, STOP and wait for "yes", feedback, or questions.

**Hackathon rule:** Build, ship, leave, move on. No multi-day follow-on building. Every hackathon is a networking event that happens to have code.

---

## EXAMPLE INTERACTION FLOW

**User:** "I just finished 6 more Structy problems today. Update tracker and tell me if I'm on pace for this week's goal of 25."

**Expected response:**
1. Read tracker.csv
2. Calculate current pace (28 done + 6 = 34 done, need 36 by Sunday)
3. Show remaining problems needed
4. Suggest distribution across remaining days
5. Update tracker.csv with new entry
6. Commit and push changes

## THE REALITY: CAREER CHANGER DOING A 2.2x COMP JUMP IN 120 DAYS

**What you're actually doing:**
- Current: $90K base ($112K TC) at Texas A&M Transportation Institute
- Target: $250K+ TC at Big Tech platform engineering (Google L4, Meta E4, Amazon SDE II, etc.)
- **That's a 2.2x total comp jump in 4 months**
- **Non-CS degree (Biomedical Science) + 8 years post-grad + career changer**

**Why this is NOT crazy:**
1. **You've already built real platform engineering work** (incremental indexing, API integration, hash-based dedup, DAG-modeled constraints)
2. **The referral strategy bypasses resume filters** (cold apps with your background = ~0%, strong referrals = 20-40%)
3. **You're willing to do the reps** (114 Structy problems in 3 weeks, 18 system designs, 8-10 mocks)
4. **The comp jump is mostly equity** (Base: 90K → 140-160K is reasonable for L4/SDE II; equity is the real difference: 0 → $80-150K/year)
5. **Market timing is on your side** (Austin tech scene, platform/infra demand, 2026 market stability)

**Adjusted timeline reality:**
- **Optimistic (30-40% probability):** April apps → May/June offers at Tier 2-3 ($200-240K)
- **Realistic (60% probability):** April apps → some interviews → 1 offer at Tier 3 ($180-220K), OR no offers → Q3/Q4 re-run → land by EOY ($200-240K)
- **Backup (90% probability):** Land mid-tier company ($140-170K) → 18 months → FAANG ($250K+)
- **Long-shot (10-15% probability):** Multiple offers → competing leverage → Google/Meta L4 at $270K+

**What changes because of non-CS background:**
1. **Referral quality matters even more** — Need "I worked with them, they can code" not "I met them once"
2. **Project stories need to hit harder** — Interviewers need to forget your degree 5 minutes into technical conversation
3. **Career transition is a secret weapon** — "Tell me about a time you learned something difficult" → entire career pivot story
4. **Target career-changer friendly companies harder** — Amazon (leadership principles > pedigree), Stripe, Datadog, Elastic
5. **Mock interviews are EVEN MORE critical** — Can't afford to freeze; need to be unshakeable in real interviews

**The "Why software engineering?" answer (60 seconds):**
"I started in biomedical science, but during undergrad I got curious about data analysis and started teaching myself Python. I realized I loved building systems and solving technical problems more than lab work. After graduation, I got a role at the Transportation Institute where I could do both — research and software engineering. Over the past 8 years, I've built production systems handling indexing, API integrations, and distributed data pipelines. I realized platform engineering is where I want to build my career, and I'm ready to do it at scale at a company like [Google/Meta/Amazon]."

**Mental model adjustment:**
You're not "90K → 250K in 120 days."
You're "I've been teaching myself software engineering for 8 years, built production platform systems, finally gotten good enough to interview at Big Tech, compressing 2 years of interview prep into 4 months, using referrals to bypass resume filters, executing so well in interviews that they forget I don't have a CS degree, and getting paid what I'm actually worth for the first time in my career."

That's not crazy. **That's overdue.**

**Lean HARD into:**
1. **Isha (Amazon) relationship** — coffee late Feb, show your work, earn a strong referral (Amazon hires career changers)
2. **Elastic talk** — crush the presentation, turn Olivia/Sophia into advocates (you connected over shared biochem → tech background)
3. **Holt (Google) bridge** — get intro to platform engineer, show you can code
4. **Behavioral story about career transition** — this is your differentiation vs Stanford CS grads

You're not competing with Stanford CS grads. You're competing with other career changers. And you're WAY ahead of most of them.

## BACKUP SCENARIOS

**If FAANG doesn't work by June:**
- **Option A:** Tier 3 companies as primary (Cloudflare, Datadog, Elastic, Stripe, Uber) — $180-220K range
- **Option B:** Austin startup play (Series B+, $140-170K+, 10x ownership)
- **Option C:** Re-prep Q3/Q4 with real interview experience, land by EOY

**If offer is lukewarm:** Take it if comp is right. Leave in 18-24 months. Logo and salary are the point.

**If entrepreneurship pull gets strong:** Deal with yourself — build after 18 months at big tech. Salary funds runway, logo gives credibility, network gives co-founders.

**You need ONE yes. Not five. Every rejection gets you closer.**
