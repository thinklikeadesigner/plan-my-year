## Hackathons This Month

### OpenClaw AI Hackathon — Feb 13 12pm → Feb 14 6pm
- **Format:** Overnight (~30 hrs)
- **Goal:** Meet engineers, build something demoable with tools you know (Python, APIs)
- **Networking:** Relationships > winning. Exchange contacts. Follow up within 48 hrs.
- **Feb 15:** Back to Structy. No post-hackathon iteration.

### YC Founders Hackathon — Feb 20 (Fri), 5 hrs (TENTATIVE)
- **Goal:** If attending — 30 min genuine conversations with YC founders/mentors. Ask about infrastructure, systems thinking. Be memorable.
- **Trade-off:** Costs ~3 hrs study time. Worth it if strong networking potential.
- **Decision rule:** Go if you have a specific person to connect with. Skip if it's just "might be cool."
- **Feb 21:** Back to Structy. No post-hackathon iteration.

### UT AI/Memory Hackathon — Feb 25, 6-8:30pm
- **Hosts:** AI Collective, AITX, Data Transfer Initiative, UT School of Law
- **Theme:** AI + personal memory data — synthetic datasets, privacy, personal data tools
- **Goal:** Meet Austin AI/policy/research community. Different crowd than pure SWE events.
- **Trade-off:** Replaces Wed evening study block (2 hrs). Low cost, high networking variety.

### Hackathon Rule
Build, ship, leave, move on. No multi-day follow-on building. Every hackathon is a networking event that happens to have code.
