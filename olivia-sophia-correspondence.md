Present at an Elastic Austin meetup!

Hi Rebecca,

I hope you're doing well! My name is Olivia Petrie, and I'm a Program Manager on the Elastic Developer Relations team. Welcome to the Elastic Community!

We're always looking for passionate community members to share their Elastic experiences, insights, and projects at our meetups—whether in person or virtually. I noticed you expressed interest in presenting when you joined the Austin Meetup chapter, so I wanted to reach out personally.

Whether you want to showcase a cool Elastic use case, dive into a technical topic, or share lessons learned, we'd love to hear your story.

If you're interested, just reply to this email, and we can chat about potential topics and next steps.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Hi Olivia,

Thanks so much for reaching out!

I'm currently working on search architecture and data normalization problems in a large WordPress staff directory (free-text specialties, relevance tuning, keyword vs. semantic tradeoffs, etc.). I've been doing a lot of evaluation work around when native WP search solutions are sufficient and when something like Elastic becomes the right next step.

If that kind of practical, tradeoff-driven talk would be a good fit for the Austin meetup, I'd love to chat and explore possible angles.

Thanks again, and looking forward to connecting.

Best,
Rebecca

Thanks, Rebecca! I think this topic would resonate well with the Austin community.

I'd love to connect you with Sophia (Elastic Developer Advocate in Austin). She's my technical counterpart for the chapter and can help you workshop the best angle. If you're open to it, could you share your email? I'll start an intro thread with you both, and from there you two can find a time to connect.

Thank you!

Looking forward to chatting with Sophia and workshopping the topic.

Hi Sophia and Rebecca,

Connecting you two! Rebecca is part of the Austin community and has a talk idea that feels like a good fit for the meetup. I wanted to make an intro so you can sync on the content, refine the angle, and (if it's a go) get it lined up for an upcoming event.

For background, Rebecca is working on search architecture and data normalization for a large WordPress staff directory (free-text specialties, relevance tuning, keyword vs. semantic tradeoffs, etc.). She's been evaluating when native WordPress search is "good enough" versus when Elastic becomes the right next step.

@Sophia Solomon is our Developer Advocate based in Austin and can workshop the best angle for the audience.

To make scheduling easy, here are a few times that should work on Sophia's calendar:

Tuesday, Feb 10 between 11-3pm CST
Wednesday, Feb 11 between 10-1pm CST
Thursday, Feb 12 between 10-12pm CST

If those don't work, just reply with a couple windows and we'll find something.

Thanks!

Hi Olivia,

Thank you so much for introducing me to Sophia! The workshop call was great. I'm excited about the talk direction.
I really appreciate you thinking of me for this opportunity. I'll follow up with Sophia separately on the outline and details.

Thanks again!
